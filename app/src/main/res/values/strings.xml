    <string name="Title"> cendrawasih dance </string>
    <string name="part1">A performance of the cendrawasih dance by Sekar Jepun, the Balinese dance troupe of Sanata Dharma University.</string>
    <string name="part2">Inspired by the courtship dance of the bird of paradise, the dance takes the form of a mating ritual. Two women dancers don Pandji-style headdresses with feathers stuck in them, as well as long flowing scarves or skirts with a pink stripe. The skirts serve as the tails of the birds of paradise, and when held their fluttering gives the impression of wings in flight. Shown here is a lone Cendrawasih dancer with her scarf hanging.
